According to a report by Axios, Representatives Mike Flood and Wiley Nickel recently wrote a letter to the commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, urging the SEC to stop discriminating against crypto funds. “We urge you, without delay, to approve options on spot Bitcoin ETPs or to provide an explanation for the Commission’s difference in treatment between options for Bitcoin futures ETFs — which are currently trading — and options for the spot Bitcoin ETPs,” reads the bipartisan letter. Options are financial instruments that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset — in this case, Bitcoin ( BTC ) — at a fixed price by a certain date. The instrument is commonly used for hedging against price movements, limiting potential losses and enabling investors to generate additional income through strategies. The approval, according to Flood and Nickel, is crucial for the investors that the SEC “seeks to protect.\" The agency has been holding off on decisions on applications from the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets submitted in January. Nasdaq filed to list and trade options on BlackRock\\'s iShares Bitcoin Trust, while Cboe intends to offer options trading on various BTC funds. Similarly, the NYSE intends to trade options on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts and any other trusts holding Bitcoin. Recently, the commission initiated a new consultation round on the proposed rule change to permit options trading on Bitcoin funds. SEC requests public feedback on Bitcoin options trading. Source: SEC According to an April 24 filing, the SEC seeks to explore how Bitcoin options might impact market stability, particularly in volatile conditions.

According to a report by Axios, Representatives Mike Flood and Wiley Nickel recently wrote a letter to the commission’s chair, Gary Gensler, urging the SEC to stop discriminating against crypto funds. “We urge you, without delay, to approve options on spot Bitcoin ETPs or to provide an explanation for the Commission’s difference in treatment between options for Bitcoin futures ETFs — which are currently trading — and options for the spot Bitcoin ETPs,” reads the bipartisan letter. Options are financial instruments that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset — in this case, Bitcoin ( BTC ) — at a fixed price by a certain date. The instrument is commonly used for hedging against price movements, limiting potential losses and enabling investors to generate additional income through strategies. The approval, according to Flood and Nickel, is crucial for the investors that the SEC “seeks to protect.\" The agency has been holding off on decisions on applications from the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets submitted in January. Nasdaq filed to list and trade options on BlackRock\\'s iShares Bitcoin Trust, while Cboe intends to offer options trading on various BTC funds. Similarly, the NYSE intends to trade options on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts and any other trusts holding Bitcoin. Recently, the commission initiated a new consultation round on the proposed rule change to permit options trading on Bitcoin funds. SEC requests public feedback on Bitcoin options trading.

After falling to $56,500 on May 1, Bitcoin received a boost from dovish economic guidance by the United States Federal Reserve. As it left interest rates predictably unchanged, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reinforced plans to cut them at some point before the end of the year. “We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation,” he said during a subsequent press conference. “At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.” Risk assets reacted well to the event, and BTC/USD continued to display relief after precipitous sell-side pressure earlier in the week. “If Bitcoin can hold these lows and move higher the chart will qualify as a very common bull market continuation chart construction,” veteran trader Peter Brandt told followers on X.

After falling to $56,500 on May 1, Bitcoin received a boost from dovish economic guidance by the United States Federal Reserve. As it left interest rates predictably unchanged, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reinforced plans to cut them at some point before the end of the year. “We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation,” he said during a subsequent press conference. “At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.” Risk assets reacted well to the event, and BTC/USD continued to display relief after precipitous sell-side pressure earlier in the week. “If Bitcoin can hold these lows and move higher the chart will qualify as a very common bull market continuation chart construction,” veteran trader Peter Brandt told followers on X.

A Bitcoin options contract is a derivative contract that allows investors to speculate on Bitcoin\\xa0price movements without owning Bitcoin itself. There are two types: call and put options. Call options give investors the right to buy a cryptocurrency at a specific price before a certain date. Put options, on the other hand, allow investors to sell a cryptocurrency at a particular price before the expiry date. Investors often use the put/call ratio as a metric to assess the general state of the market. If traders are purchasing more puts than calls, it is considered a bearish sign, and if they are purchasing more calls than puts, then the market sentiment is considered bullish. A put-to-call ratio below 0.7 is considered bullish, while a ratio of more than 1 is regarded as a bearish indicator.

The Ether price also fell below $2,900. The crypto market often bounces back from the options-led volatility within days of expiry.

However, the price of Bitcoin has fallen almost 7% since the products launched, according to CoinMarketCap data. WhereAt Social co-founder and crypto trader Quinten Francois suggested the behavior holds similarities to the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which saw the price of Bitcoin fall 14% within 12 days of their launch before rising 7% over the following seven days. If Bitcoin’s price continues to follow the same trend, it could see an upswing in the “next week or so,” Francois said in a May 1 post on X. “There is no straight line to the top. Price correction was more than needed,” added pseudonymous crypto trader StockLizard. Source: Quinten|048.eth However, there are some key differences between the two launches. While Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs have seen $217 million worth of net inflows since launching, U.S. ETFs experienced $794 million in outflows over the same period. The Hong Kong-based ETFs also accumulated only $12.4 million in trading volume on their first day, a major difference from the $4.6 billion first-day trading volume of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Hong Kong’s ETF launches also came just after the Bitcoin halving, which often comes with a period of “sideways” price action along with continued heightened tensions in the Middle East and the U.S. Federal Reserve maintaining high interest\\xa0rates . However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas argued in an April 30 post on X that this is a high figure considering the size of Hong Kong is approximately “1/168th the size of the U.S.” Some traders are concerned that inflows from Hong Kong might not be sufficient to offset the large amount of recent outflows from the U.S., potentially preventing a similar breakout pattern. “Hong Kong Bitcoin ETFs are not enough to absorb US ETF selling pressure,” Crypto trading team TOBTC stated in a May 2 post on X.

They should be rejected by all fair-minded blockchain leaders, but that unfortunately is not the case. In June 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted that most cryptocurrency innovations have come from the private sector. But it praised central banks for “catching up” through the experimentation of CBDCs and creating state-controlled instant payment systems — like Brazil’s Pix. CBDCs are an experimental form of digital money created by a country's central bank. They are generally controlled through a private network and are both centralized and programmable. This means that central banks can track, monitor and edit transactions. Such capabilities grant authorities extensive control over money flows — including the power to impose spending restrictions, set “expiration” dates on consumers’ savings, and even remotely freeze or seize money. And by 2030, CitiGroup predicts there will be $5 trillion in CBDCs circulating in the global economy. Related: Jerome Powell’s pivot heralds a boring summer for Bitcoin While some crypto leaders have been quietly concerned about the rise of CBDCs and what they could mean for privacy, democracy and rising authoritarianism, others have openly supported them — even as they paradoxically promote the advantages of decentralized technologies. CitiGroup projections for the level of CBDC usage in 2030. Source: CitiGroup Consensys, the owner of MetaMask and Infura, is one example. It is widely recognized as a foundational force in blockchain technology. It also has an incredibly flirtatious relationship with CBDCS. In partnership with Visa, Consensys is crafting new infrastructure designed to bridge central banks with traditional financial institutions. Other cryptocurrency projects — including Ripple ( XRP ) and Stellar ( XLM ) — have likewise been active in allowing their blockchains to be used in the development of CBDCs. Ripple's\\xa0native cryptocurrency, XRP, operates on a decentralized public ledger akin to Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ( ETH ). Yet, in 2021, Ripple introduced a CBDC platform on a separate, private ledger designed specifically for governments, central banks, and financial institutions. This setup allows these entities to exercise complete control over their newfound digital currencies. Conversely, Stellar advocates for creating CBDCs on its public blockchain, albeit with custom adjustments that allow centralized entities to enhance governance. Within its CBDC Guidebook , Stellar suggests managing monetary policy and programmability centrally but maintaining a decentralized approach to the technological infrastructure and service delivery. In a perfect world, you'd hope major blockchain players like Ripple and Stellar — with their significant banking connections — could use their influence to resist CBDCs on morality grounds, despite the tempting business prospects they present. Yet, even in an imperfect world, it would be impactful for them to openly discuss the real long-term threats of CBDCs — particularly the risks of giving governments overwhelming financial omnipotence. Of course, blockchain pioneers might be happy to see their formerly marginalized technology now discussed in high-level forums such as the IMF and Davos. Yet, while this recognition may be gratifying, it doesn’t translate into a victory for the ideals of blockchain technology. It’s quite the opposite: CBDCs compromise the core principles and benefits of blockchain — such as immutability and decentralization. Can governments be trusted with such power? Historically, the answer is “No,” even in the West. Canada served as one example in 2022 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau activated the Emergencies Act to unconstitutionally freeze bank accounts linked to anti-lockdown protesters . United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt provided another example when, in 1933, he signed an executive order mandating that citizens hand their gold over to the federal government — or face up to $10,000 in fines and 10 years in prison. Regardless of the consumer safeguards that may be implemented within various future CBDCs, governments will certainly retain extensive control to modify, adjust, and redefine the rules governing this future form of money over time. Related: Solana illustrates the dark side of monolithic blockchains When it suits them, western governments will impose financial sanctions against their own citizens for political means. It's not rocket science to understand embracing CBDCs risks emboldening and normalizing the use of these measures. Cryptocurrencies have been mocked, ridiculed and admittedly have a PR problem following the collapse of FTX and other scammers in the industry. But despite all of cryptos' challenges, its technology, applications and ethos makes the need for CBDCs redundant. We don't need CBDCs for fast, low-fee, accessible transactions for all. Crypto can already do it. With KYC (know your customer) measures, governments can already monitor, tax income and crack down on money laundering in crypto where it arises, without the need for excessive centralized control. CBDCs could be the start of a very slippery slope towards an authoritarian new norm. It's up to our greatest minds and leaders in both blockchain and beyond to wake up and stop flirting with CBDCs. Thought leaders can actively fight back by supporting decentralized alternatives. However, being more vocal in both opposing and challenging CBDCs will empower others to do the same. The current bull run will draw in millions of new investors and enthusiasts — maybe up to 1 billion by the end of 2025. Let's leverage this publicity to spread the word that CBDCs are not the only way forward.

It’s valuable,” Warwick told Cointelegraph at MemeGlobal Sydney. He added he wasn’t totally sold on memecoin critics’ arguments that the assets aren’t creating utility . Warwick — who is set to launch his “on-chain gateway” platform Infinex this month — explained that “out of memecoin trading, you get DEX volume and then DEXs have to respond and build better tools.” “Even if the investment is in a purely speculative instrument that has no utility, the ecosystem around it starts to form and that money flows through and the investment flows through into infrastructure, which I think is good.” Memecoin trading has surged in the last two months. The bulk of trading happens on DEXs as token creation tools like pump.fun makes them easy and cheap to launch — the majority are short-lived and don’t last long enough to get a centralized exchange listing. Monthly DEX volumes for March reached a nearly two-and-a-half-year high of $267.9 billion — just below the $292 billion November 2021 record at the peak of the last market cycle, according to DefiLlama. DEX volumes by month since 2021. Source: DefiLlama April figures saw $196 billion in DEX volumes — a 26.8% drop from March but still the seventh-strongest month overall. Speaking at the May 2 ETHGlobal Pragma Sydney event, Warwick said memecoins, nonfungible tokens ( NFTs ) and GameFi “tap into more of a human emotion and cultural idea, which is much more interesting and accessible and addressable to the average person than DeFi.” “Financial engineering is not that interesting,” he added. “There’s just not that many people that find it deeply interesting.” Kain Warwick on stage at MemeGlobal Sydney. Source: Jesse Coghlan/Cointelegraph Warwick said that while finance is “impactful to everyone” it’s not something people think about every day — “the average person doesn’t care.” Related: Fantom bets on ‘safer memecoins’ with launch of $6.5M dev fund Games, movies and music , however, were things Warwick believed the average person is “passionate about and really cares about.” “I think memes are maybe the most simplistic connection between financialization and tokenization of everything, and culture.” He added memecoins are “quite useful” as a “hook to get people interested” in DeFi and crypto. “There is something elegant in the simplicity of it,” Warwick said. “There’s no yield or revenue or cash flow or anything. It’s just: ‘Is this a dumb cool idea that I want to own, or is it not?’ That’s it.” Magazine: Meme coins: Betrayal of crypto’s ideals… or its true purpose?

Block Inc. has pledged to invest 10% of its gross profit from its Bitcoin-related business back into the cryptocurrency each month, and a Nigerian judge has postponed a money laundering trial of Binance executive. Bitcoin and Ether options worth $2.4 bilion set to expire Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) options contracts worth a combined $2.4 billion are set to expire on May 3, which could lead to increased market volatility. A Bitcoin options contract is a derivative contract that allows investors to speculate on Bitcoin price movements without owning Bitcoin itself. There are two types: call and put options. Call options give investors the right to buy a cryptocurrency at a specific price before a certain date. Put options, on the other hand, allow investors to sell a cryptocurrency at a particular price before the expiry date. On May 3, a total of 23,367 Bitcoin contracts worth $1.39 billion are set to expire. Data from the Deribit exchange reveal that the put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options contracts is currently at 0.5, with a maximum pain point of $61,000. The maximum pain point refers to the price at which the asset will cause financial losses to the greatest number of holders. Bitcoin options expiry. Source: Deribit Similarly, a total of 334,248 Ether contracts with a notional value of $1 billion are expected to expire on Friday as well. These expiring contracts have a put-to-call ratio of 0.37 and a maximum pain point of $3,000. Ether options expiry. Source: Deribit The expiry of options contracts has historically been followed by short-term price volatility in the spot crypto market. Bitcoin and Ether have experienced bearish pressure in the past couple of weeks. Jack Dorsey’s Block is ‘DCA’ing’ into Bitcoin every month Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said his fintech firm Block, Inc. will flip 10% of its gross profit made off its Bitcoin products into buying Bitcoin ( BTC ) every month. “Going forward, each month we will be investing 10% of our gross profit from Bitcoin products into Bitcoin purchases,” Dorsey wrote in a May 2 shareholder letter inclusive of its better-than-expected first-quarter results. Source: Michael Saylor “We were one of the first public companies to put Bitcoin on our balance sheet,” he added. Block bought $220 million worth of BTC across Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. “Our investment in Bitcoin transcends technology; it is an investment in a future where economic empowerment is the norm.” Block’s Bitcoin gross profit for the first quarter of 2024 through customer sales with its Cash App business was up nearly 60% year-on-year to $80.1 million. 10% of this amount could buy it around 1,350 BTC at its current price of $59,250. Nigerian court postpones money laundering trial of Binance and execs A Nigerian judge has reportedly paused the case against Tigran Gambaryan , a Binance executive detained in Nigeria since February 2024, until May 16. The trial would have begun on May 2nd, but attorneys for Binance were given a temporary adjournment after claiming they hadn’t yet received crucial documents related to the case. Gambaryan reportedly traveled to Nigeria with Binance regional manager Nadeem Anjarwalla in February to address legal concerns. The two were then detained and held on charges of money laundering and tax evasion. Anjarwalla is alleged to have escaped custody and fled Nigeria.

    "here are the key industry-specific terminologies or jargon that may need clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BTC**: This is the ticker symbol for Bitcoin, the world's largest and most well-known cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Liquidations**: In the context of cryptocurrency trading, liquidations refer to the forced closure of a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. This typically happens when the market moves against the trader's position, and their remaining funds are insufficient to maintain the required margin level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs)**: These are exchange-traded funds that track the spot (or current market) price of an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin. Unlike futures-based ETFs, spot ETFs directly hold the underlying asset, providing investors with exposure to the asset's price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trading volumes**: This refers to the total amount of an asset (in this case, Bitcoin) that has been traded over a specific period, typically measured in the base currency (e.g., US dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Net outflows**: In the context of ETFs, net outflows refer to the situation where more investors are redeeming or selling their ETF shares than buying new shares. This can indicate a decrease in investor demand for the underlying asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exponential moving average (EMA)**: This is a type of technical indicator used in financial analysis that gives more weight to recent price data, making it more responsive to recent price movements compared to a simple moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Futures shorting**: Shorting futures contracts involves taking a bearish position on an asset by selling futures contracts with the expectation of buying them back at a lower price in the future. This is a way for traders to speculate on price declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Support and resistance levels**: These are technical analysis terms referring to price levels where the asset's price tends to encounter buying (support) or selling (resistance) pressure, potentially causing a reversal or consolidation in the price movement.\n",

       "'Here is my analysis of the crypto news you provided:\\n\\nToken Identification and Price Movement Analysis:\\n- The main tokens mentioned are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). \\n- The current price movement is not explicitly stated, but it\\'s implied there has been some recent bearish pressure on BTC and ETH prices in the past couple weeks.\\n- Current Price Movement Confidence Score: 0.6 (moderate confidence based on implied bearish sentiment but lack of specific price data)\\n\\nPrice Prediction and Confidence Scoring:\\n\\nBitcoin (BTC)\\n- Predicted Price 1: $61,000 \\n- Predicted Price 1 Confidence Score: 0.7\\n- Estimated Time Frame for Predicted Price 1: Short-term (next few days) based on options expiry max pain point\\n   \\n- Predicted Price 2: $56,000\\n- Predicted Price 2 Confidence Score: 0.5  \\n- Estimated Time Frame for Predicted Price 2: 1-2 weeks\\n   \\n- Predicted Price 3: $65,000\\n- Predicted Price 3 Confidence Score: 0.4\\n- Estimated Time Frame for Predicted Price 3: 1 month\\n\\nEthereum (ETH)  \\n- Predicted Price 1: $3,000\\n- Predicted Price 1 Confidence Score: 0.7 \\n- Estimated Time Frame for Predicted Price 1: Short-term (next few days) based on options expiry max pain point\\n   \\n- Predicted Price 2: $2,800\\n- Predicted Price 2 Confidence Score: 0.5\\n- Estimated Time Frame for Predicted Price 2: 1-2 weeks\\n   \\n- Predicted Price 3: $3,300  \\n- Predicted Price 3 Confidence Score: 0.4\\n- Estimated Time Frame for Predicted Price 3: 1 month\\n\\nThe key factors influencing the price predictions are:\\n\\n1) The upcoming expiry of $2.4B in BTC and ETH options contracts on May 3 is likely to cause short-term volatility, with max pain points of $61K for BTC and $3K for ETH. This provides moderate confidence for those short-term price targets.\\n\\n2) Block Inc. committing to invest 10% of Bitcoin profits into BTC each month provides some long-term bullish support. \\n\\n3) The postponed Binance money laundering trial introduces some regulatory uncertainty.\\n\\nOverall, while there are some bullish factors like the Block news, the large options expiry and recent bearish price action lead to only low-moderate confidence in higher price predictions over the next month. Close monitoring of price action after the May 3 options expiry will be important.\\n\\nUser: Here is the latest crypto news:\\n\\nBitcoin sub-$60K levels in focus after daily crypto liquidations near $300M\\nBitcoin bears are out in force with BTC price trajectory quickly headed back to $60,000.\\nBitcoin \\nBTC\\nBTC price suddenly retargets $60,000\\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked a precipitous drop on BTC/USD after the Asia trading session, with the pair losing $61,000 support.\\n\\nLiquidations quickly mounted across crypto, totaling $275 million over 24 hours, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.\\n\\ntickers down\\n$57,217\\n\\n hit two-week lows around the April 30 Wall Street open after new spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) disappointed.\\nThe already cautious mood turned firmly bearish as it emerged that the first day\\'s trading volumes for Hong Kong\\'s new Bitcoin ETFs had fallen considerably below expectations.\\n\\nThe new products managed $12.4 million — still impressive for the size of the local market, per Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, Eric Balchunas.\\n\\nIn a reaction on X (formerly Twitter), Balchunas gave a distinctly positive impression of the first day\\'s performance.\\n\\n\"East vs West: The US did $740m in assets and $4.6b in trading.
